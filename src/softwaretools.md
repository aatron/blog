* IDE
    * [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) - Greatest IDE of all time.
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Cool younger cousin of VS. Very Atom-ish, still in beta, and used exclusively to write this blog.
* Security
    * [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) - Free SSL Certificate Authority
* Non-developer tools
    * [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) - Changes monitor color to give your eyes a break at night. Seems cheesy but is really helpful.
    * [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/) > MS Paint
* [Placeholder for future awesomeness]
