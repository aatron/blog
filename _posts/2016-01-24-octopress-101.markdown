### Here's why static site generators rock:

* Terms of Use for blog hosting services are confusing
* Seriously....who owns the data?!
* Speed. Doesn't get any faster than static pages.

### Here's what I use to write my site:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - open source cross-platform IDE
* [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) - opinionated set of tools based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
    * **Be cool**, include the attribution at the bottom.
* [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) - Rendered code blocks better than kramdown

### Lessons learned:

* Jekyll
    * Access Site variables from Liquid templates
        * Example on how plug-ins can get access to the site's _config.yml: 

            `context.registers[:site].config.["title"]`
        
    * IIS - don't test using virtual directories
        * Virtual directory for the blog creates issues with the links.

    * Test by running `jekyll serve` and navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) 
        * You can change the port # by setting the value port in _config.yml like this: 

            `port: 4470 # or any other port number`
    
        * Auto updates as you change files, just refresh pages
    * Commands
        * http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#commands
        * Commands *have* to be wrapped in a gem that is added to the jekyll_plugins section
