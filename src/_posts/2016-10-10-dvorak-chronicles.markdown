### Dvorak vs Qwerty

Dvorak and Qwerty are two different keyboard layouts. Qwerty is what most people type in. [Mario](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Mario_Teaches_Typing_1992) taught me how to type in Qwerty.

After seeing a convincing [lightning talk](http://lanyrd.com/2016/netfringe/sfdbxg/) at [.Net Fringe](http://dotnetfringe.org/) about the benefits of using the Dvorak keyboard layout, I decided to switch. The main selling point for me was that it is easier on the wrists. I am becoming more conscious of my health lately and this is enough for me to give it a go.

### Why would you switch?

You can pretentiously say, "Dah-vor-jack," then hop on your penny-farthing and ride off into the sunset without yielding to traffic.

### Why wouldn't you switch?

A few people tried telling me that it's been disproven that Dvorak is faster to type in. I am quite skeptical of this and too lazy to research such a benign controversy. With that being said, there is *no* way that Qwerty is a faster layout. Only one vowel is on Qwerty's home row vs all the vowels are on Dvorak's layout.

Strangely enough, you can only type in one keyboard format. It's not like learning how to play two different instruments. I often look like I don't know what I'm doing when I use a shared computer.

### Problems Experienced

Overall, I underestimated how much work it would be to switch over. Qwerty is an extension of me. When I write with a pencil, I sometimes make the same typos as if I was typing.

Additionally, I made things harder on myself by touch typing Dvorak on a Qwerty keyboard. That way, my impact on my family and co-workers is limited.

### Reality Check

You might be thinking something like:

> Most people that blog about Dvorak see the world through the cloudy lens of their absinthe glass and are trying to have a keyboard revolution...are you trying to talk me out of using Dvorak?

My children won't learn Dvorak and neither should yours. Nevertheless, I am optimistic that Dvorak is worth the experiment for me.
